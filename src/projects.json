      "Hi! I'm Sam, and I'm a web developer! And a statistician! And a few other things, but mostly those first two.",
      "I’m a self-motivated individual who specializes in building complete solutions to problems in web development and risk analysis. I prefer to work on many aspects of a project concurrently so that I can develop a better understanding of how each piece should fit together. My background in statistics necessitated learning coding tools in order to more effectively answer complex questions about the world. Since graduating, I’ve been focused on learning new ways to apply my skills in mathematics and code to a wide array of problems. I enjoy working with small teams of open-minded individuals with different ways of thinking -- being exposed to different viewpoints is a great way to diversify one’s approach to problems both inside and outside of a work environment. I’m looking forward to making a difference in the workplace by bringing my skills and talents."

The Hermite functions are orthogonal over the whole real line with respect to an exponential weighting function. As I worked with them, I found that they could be used to approximate any continuous function function on the real line, using a similar approach that one would take to derive a Fourier series.",

If one instead sums the previous three terms, the ratio between successive terms approaches roughly 1.8393. What I wondered was if there was a good way to derive that value directly from the number of terms.",
